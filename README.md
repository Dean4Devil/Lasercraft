Lasercraft
==========

Oh, hello there! You've found the GitHub repo of LaserCraft, a mod made by JoshTheEnder.
This mod is going to add lasers ( no s**t Sherlock ) to minecraft which can do all sorts of things.
The source code in the repo, as of me updating this readme, is for Minecraft 1.6.4 though I will be migrating over to 1.7.2 in the next few days.

That's all for now folks!
