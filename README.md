Lasercraft
==========

Oh, hello there! You've found the GitHub repo of LaserCraft, a mod made by JoshTheEnder.
This mod is going to add lasers ( no s**t Sherlock ) to minecraft which can do all sorts of things.
~The source code in the repo, as of me updating this readme, is for Minecraft 1.6.4 though I will be migrating over to 1.7.2 in the next few days.~ default branch is 1.7, it's broken though and I haven't had time to go through and work out why.

That's all for now folks!

Version schemeing is as follows: MCVersion-Major:Minor-BuildNumber

[![Build Status](http://www.theender.net/jenkins/buildStatus/icon?job=LaserCraft)](http://www.theender.net/jenkins/job/LaserCraft/)

We also have a channel on EsperNet, it's tag is #LaserCraft, come join us (and pester me to do stuff on this :P)


Testing jenkins marking of successfull/failed builds on commits, still testing.... (might need to be triggered by an actual commit)
