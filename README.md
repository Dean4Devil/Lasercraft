Lasercraft
==========

Oh, hello there! You've found the GitHub repo of LaserCraft, a mod made by JoshTheEnder.
This mod is going to add lasers ( no s**t Sherlock ) to minecraft which can do all sorts of things.
~The source code in the repo, as of me updating this readme, is for Minecraft 1.6.4 though I will be migrating over to 1.7.2 in the next few days.~ default branch is 1.7, it's broken though and I haven't had time to go through and work out why.

That's all for now folks!


Also; the version scheme is going to be like _major code refractor_._new feature_._bugfix_ so fixing a bug will do 0.0.+1 and a new feature will do 0.+1.0

We also have a channel on EsperNet, it's tag is #LaserCraft, come join us (and pester me to do stuff on this :P)
